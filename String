String are immutable in java as following reasons:-

1. The string in java cannot be modified because of security reasons, synchronization
	which makes others not able to edit it.

Difference between string and string builder.!
Strings should be used when we know we are not going to use it later 
it means we don't need to change the variable later on in our project. 

String builder is the best way to write a string when we know we may have to 
change the current String variable at later journey. So String Builder
makes possible to re edit the string at later part of the project.

Example :-

String str 1 = "Abc";
String str 2 = "Abc";

here both are same and it will print true when we compare it.
System.out.println(str1 == str2);

but 
String str1 = "Abc";
String str2 = new String("Abc);

here even though both addresses are same still we will get false when we try 
to compare it.
System.out.print(str1 == str2);
